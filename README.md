# API Integration and Data Visualization

This project highlights the integration of external APIs and the use of data visualization techniques to present insights from real-world data. The first part of the project uses the OMDb API to retrieve detailed movie information based on user input. This includes data such as the movie title, year of release, genre, and director. Additionally, users have the option to download the movie poster directly from the OMDb API, showcasing the ability to extract and utilize multimedia assets alongside structured data. In a separate task, the Weather API was used to retrieve real-time weather information for Portland, with the API response formatted as JSON and displayed in a user-friendly format.

The second part of the project explores data visualization using a dataset of Netflix users. The dataset contains information such as subscription types, gender, age, and country. By employing the `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` libraries, various visualizations were created to illustrate key insights, including the distribution of subscription types, gender proportions, and the age distribution of users. These visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of user demographics and subscription behaviors, offering valuable insights for further analysis.

The combination of API integration and data visualization demonstrates the power of connecting real-world data sources with effective visual representation. Python was used throughout, with `requests` for API interaction, `Matplotlib` for creating static plots, and `Seaborn` for producing statistical visualizations. The project can be reproduced by running the provided Python scripts, which retrieve data from the APIs and generate visualizations from the Netflix dataset.
